# Handwritten Digit Recognition using DNN / CNN (trained by Tensorflow / Keras) :

This is a Machine Learning project based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) & Dense Neural Network(DNN). 
I trained the model using MNIST data-set and used TensorFlow as a training back-end. Used mostly Keras ( wrapper of Tensorflow) 
to get the HDF5 output. Then convert the .h5 file into .mlmodel which can be used in xcode.
